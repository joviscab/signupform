# Odin Project - Sign-up Form

## Who am I? What is this?

Hello, my name is Joviscab and this is part of my learning to code journey!

This project is called Sign-up Form and is part of the Intermediate HTML and CSS Course of The Odin Project. The idea of this project is to put to practice all the knowledge that I have acquired until now. In this project I am going to build a Sign-up Form, following the instructions of Odin's lesson! The Sign-up Form will consist in a single page with a image and some forms.

## Skills

With this project my idea is to check the Form basics and validation skills that I have learned until now, as well as using it as an exercise to remember all the lessons until this point.
